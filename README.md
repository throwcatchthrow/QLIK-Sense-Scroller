# QLIK-Sense-Scroller
A Chrome Extension to help QLIK Sense scroll/page through a Dashboard. The goal is to allow this to occur passively for display on a Television.

How to use
1) Open an application in QLIK Sense
2) From the extension pop-up, set your time per sheet (in seconds) and hit Start Scrolling.
3) Your application should scroll through each of the pages back and forth on a continuous loop!


Key Feautures:
- Automatically scrolls/pages through each sheet in a dashbaord on an automated timer
- Can be paused and resumed
- Timer can be adjusted as required
- If your session times it, the page is refreshed

Known Bugs:
- On timer change and play/pause, it sometimes takes an extra loop for the changes to take effect.
